# Facebook Birthday Thanks!

So last year, on my birthday, I was thinking of a way that would allow me to somehow automate the process of thanking people for wishing me a happy birthday. Nowadays, thanks to the ridiculous state of social connectivity, hundreds of people wish you a happy birthday on Facebook. I thought that there just HAD to be a better (or more clever) way of thanking people without posting a "thanks everyone" status... and this script was born.

## Getting Started

- Python 2.7 is required (I know, I know... not Py3)
- Install the dependencies with PIP `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Get a Facebook Access Token with "read_stream" and "publish_stream" permissions
- Define an environment variable named "FB_ACCESS_TOKEN" with the value of the token you just aquired
- Run it! `python thanks.py`
